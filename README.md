# Starminder

**Starminder** is a GitHub starred project reminder. ‚≠ê

If you have any number of starred projects, you probably have very little idea what's in there. **Starminder** aims to periodically remind you of some random ones, so you don't forget about them entirely.


## Contributing

Unlike most of my projects, contributions are not explicitly encouraged, though they're not discouraged, either.
