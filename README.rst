Starminder: Remind yourself of your GitHub stars
================================================

**Starminder** is a GitHub starred project reminder.

If you have any number of starred projects, you probably have very little idea what's in there. Starminder aims to periodically remind you of some random ones, so you don't forget about them entirely.
